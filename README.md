# Colin's Crocs
Genre: Side-scrolling adventre | Platform: Windows, Xbox One, Linux

## Summary
The hero of our story - veteran Dr Who actor Colin Baker, has had his collection of crocs shoes stolen.  He must battle through a number of levels recovering his beloved footware and battling the evil warlocks who stole his favourite shoes, and their morlock underlings.

## Key Game Features
### 'Side Scrolling' adventure
Players venture through the various levels of the Bakerverse through a traditional 2D platformer model. However the player will have more depth to their player experience through the literal use of 3D depth.  Using the shoulder buttons, the player will be able to rotate the camera around Colin, opening new areas of the level.
### Shoes - oh so many shoes
Colin will venture forth on his quest armed with his almost uncanny ability to jump and land on his enemies.  As he progresses through the level however he can also open stong boxes through the collection of appropriately coloured keys.  Each level will have strong boxes of different colours, and keys may be kept and stored in inventory until use.  Some strong boxes feature a single lock (for example : a Green Strongbox).  and this would require a single green key.  Some boxes may have multiple locks, and in those instances may require more keys.  The locks will be displayed on the front of the box.  More locks mean bigger boxes (longer) and therefore a bigger reward or more rewards
### Lock & Key
As mentioned above Colin will be carrying a collection of keys.  Colin starts his level with the knowledge that there are a limited number of shoes hidden somewhere in the level.  To complete the level he needs to find the portal key, which will teleport him to the next level. Level Keys are not the same as strongbox keys.  it is therefore possible to complete the level and therefore the game withoug collectin any shoes.  In addition to red / Yellow / Green keys, an rainbow key is available that can be substuitued for any key colour.
### Overworld
Once Colin has located the portal key for the next level he can access the level at anytime from the overworld.  The overworld is like a map that shows the potential levels that the player can play.  This allows a player to re-play a level and get those extra shoes that they failed to collect last time.
### level preservation
Once a shoe has been collected it stays collected.  Each shoe will have a unique identifier, allowing a loaded game to automatically extract or remove shoes that have been collected and exist in colin's inventory.  Dying within a level restores the shoes collected during that attempt back to the level.  Only shoes that are successfully bought back using the portal exit are added to colin's perminant inventory.  Likewise strongboxes that are opened and keys that are spent are only preserved when Colin exits the portal.
### special shoes
Like Data from the Goonies, Colin can equip himself with shoes that can add abilities - typically timed.  These include

* Spring Shoes - double jump height
* Invulnerability 
* Fireball - colin kicks a magical firey football

### Lives
Colin get 6 lives - naturally

### Health
If Colin gets hit by an enemy morelock, or falls too far he looses health.  If his health reaches 0 he dies.  He can recover health by eating Mashed Potato and ketchup - these are left by enemeies that he successfully kills.  Some enemies won't be killable (unless equipped with the power boots) - in that case jumping on an enemy will stun them, but not kill them.  Some enemies will be destroyed by jumping on them, - and these are the enemies that will drop food.  Colin can store food in his inventory - whether that should be all food that can't be used, or limited to only x slots for food will be determined by playability.  If colin is injured and he has food in his inventory then this can be dropped by the user , and the food item will appear in front of Colin to collect.

### Shops
Colin can collect coins from jumping on morlocks and warlocks, and these coins can be exchanged at the trading post.  There is one trading post that has to be unlocked, but can be accessed from the over world once unlocked.  Items can be bought or sold directly into Colin's inventory.

### Seuss 
Initially I wrote a teaser for thies game in the style of Dr Seuss : 

Colin baker - 6th of "The Docs's"
Has quite an abundant collection of Crocs's
(which he wears round the house with fetching white sock's)
To keep then safe he kept them in boxes
Sealed with sticky tape, and locked up with locks'es

But the boxes with lockss 
containing Colin's Croc's 
have been taken by warlocks'es
from Colin's Strongboxes.

the chief of the warlocks
has an army of morlocks
that were stronger than oxes
with tough skin like rock'es

So outfox the warlocks's
recover the shoeboxes
restore the Croc's
to the doc's strongboxes

 --or --

So outfox the warlocks's
get past the Morlocks'es 
recover the shoeboxes
and restore the doc's Croc'es
